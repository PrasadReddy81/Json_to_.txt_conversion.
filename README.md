YOLO (You Only Look Once) training, converting JSON files to .txt files is crucial because YOLO typically requires annotation data in a specific format stored in .txt files.
Compatibility with YOLO Format:
    YOLO models expect annotation data (such as bounding boxes and class labels) to be in a plain text format (.txt). This file format specifies each object in the image with its class label, and normalized coordinates (center_x, center_y, width, height) relative to the image size.
    JSON files, on the other hand, often store annotations in a structured format (e.g., COCO dataset) that includes additional metadata and uses a different coordinate system (absolute pixel values rather than normalized values). Directly using JSON files for YOLO training isn't possible without conversion.
Efficiency in Training:

    YOLOâ€™s training process is optimized to read simple .txt files that contain only the necessary information for object detection. This makes the training process faster and more efficient since the model can quickly load and parse the annotations.
    JSON files can be more complex and may include nested structures, which can slow down data loading and require additional processing.
Ease of Integration with YOLO Frameworks:

    Most YOLO implementations and tools, including the Darknet framework, are designed to work with .txt files for annotations. By converting JSON files to .txt, you ensure smooth integration with these tools, avoiding errors and simplifying the training pipeline.

Simplified Data Preparation:

    During data preparation, converting annotations from JSON to .txt allows you to standardize your dataset format. This is particularly important when combining multiple datasets or when you need to ensure that all your data is in the correct format for training.
